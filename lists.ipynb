    "What's a dynamically sized array?\n",
    "- \"an array with a big improvement: automatic resizing. One limitation of arrays is that they're fixed size, meaning you need to specify the number of elements your array will hold ahead of time. A dynamic array expands as you add more elements. So you don't need to determine the size ahead of time.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "- The basic idea of resizing a dynamic array is to create a new array with a different capacity and copy the elements from the old array to the new one\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"it automatically grows when we try to make an insertion and there is no more space left for the new item. Usually the area doubles in size. A simple dynamic array can be constructed by allocating an array of fixed-size, typically larger than the number of elements immediately required. The elements of the dynamic array are stored contiguously at the start of the underlying array, and the remaining positions towards the end of the underlying array are reserved, or unused. Elements can be added at the end of a dynamic array in constant time by using the reserved space until this space is completely consumed. When all space is consumed, and an additional element is to be added, the underlying fixed-sized array needs to be increased in size. Typically resizing is expensive because you have to allocate a bigger array and copy over all of the elements from the array you have overgrow before we can finally append our item.\" - geeksforgeeks\n",

    "-Without the specifics above, we use lists to store multiple items in a single variable. It's just a collection of things.\n",
    "\n",
    "-A list can also contain a mix of Python types including strings, floats, and booleans. \n",
    "\n",
    "-So the difference between a list and an array is the size of the list is dynamically allocated (it automatically resizes itself by creating a new lists with a larger capacity with all the elements/items in the original list)\n"
