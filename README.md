# learn-python
~This repo is how I learn python. I made this for myself and wanted to upload it here for anyone to also use to learn and that likes to have more elaborate explanations like myself. I provide definitions, more elaboration on how certain things work (and will probably update explanations since this I made this for myself) and any other things that drive me crazy if I don't know it fully. 

~I am open to criticism anything here, but keep in mind that I am not even close to being a good python programmer, this is strictly for me and I just uploaded it to keep track of it. 

~I find python at face value to be simple but also insanely complicated. There are so many built in functions to know and certain rules and aspects within those functions that are easily forgettable, ergo whenever I inevitably do forget something, this is where I will come back to since only my past self can explain it better to me (if I have encountered it before and have understood it in the past).
